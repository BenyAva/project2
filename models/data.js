Although this car was the sixth-generation model to bear the GT-R name, the model is no longer part of the Nissan Skyline model line up since that name is now reserved for Nissan's luxury-sport vehicles. The GT-R is built on the exclusively-developed Nissan PM platform, which is an enhanced evolution of the Nissan FM platform used in the separate Nissan Skyline luxury car and the Nissan Z sports car. The GT-R abbreviation stands for Gran Turismo-Racing, obtained from the Skyline GT-R."
